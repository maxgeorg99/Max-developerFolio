# 40 Years of Database Evolution

## Introduction
Over the past four decades, databases have quietly shaped the backbone of the digital world. From the early relational systems born in research labs in the 1970s to today’s globally distributed, cloud-native platforms, every generation of database technology has tried to solve the same core problem: how to store, retrieve, and trust data efficiently at scale.

Yet the story of databases isn’t just one of progress — it’s also one of trade-offs. The relational revolution of the 1980s gave us order, consistency, and a shared language in SQL, while the NoSQL wave of the 2000s broke that order to gain flexibility and performance. Now, in the era of cloud and AI-driven workloads, new players promise the best of both worlds — but often at the cost of complexity or vendor lock-in.

In this post, we’ll look back at how databases have evolved over the last 40 years, explore what modern systems get right (and wrong), and highlight the technologies and standards that continue to define reliability and scalability in today’s data-driven landscape.
