*October 20, 2025*

On my journey through the world of game development, I've come to appreciate the importance of selecting the right game engine for your project.
Driven by the fear of making the wrong choice, I've learned to research and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the most popular game engines.
Of course its usually the fastest and most productive way to just use the technology you are most comfortable with.
I could have just used Java a language that is already known in detail and is widely used in game development and runs everywhere.
For example, my former colleague Andreas built amazing indie games using Java like Astroloot or Mazebert.

But I wanted to explore other options and like everywhere in software development what the tradeoffs of different technologies are.

Let me share my insights on the current landscape of game engines and when to use each one.

## The Contenders

### Unity
**Best for:** Cross-platform 2D/3D games, mobile games, indie projects

**Pros:**
- Massive asset store and community
- Excellent cross-platform support (mobile, desktop, web, console)
- C# scripting (great for developers with .NET background)
- Strong 2D tooling
- Visual scripting with Bolt/Visual Scripting

**Cons:**
- Licensing changes have created uncertainty
- Can be resource-heavy
- Runtime fees for larger projects

**My Take:** Unity is still a solid choice for indie developers and mobile games. The C# ecosystem is fantastic, and the cross-platform capabilities are hard to beat. However, keep an eye on the licensing terms.

### Unreal Engine
**Best for:** AAA-quality 3D games, photorealistic graphics, architectural visualization

**Pros:**
- Stunning graphics out of the box with Lumen and Nanite
- Blueprint visual scripting
- Free until you earn significant revenue
- Industry-standard for high-fidelity games
- Excellent documentation and learning resources

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve
- C++ can be intimidating for beginners
- Heavy system requirements
- Overkill for simple 2D games

**My Take:** If you're building something that needs to look visually stunning or you're targeting next-gen consoles, Unreal is unmatched. The Blueprint system is powerful, but learning C++ opens up the full potential.

### Godot
**Best for:** Indie 2D games, open-source projects, learning game development

**Pros:**
- Completely free and open-source (MIT license)
- Lightweight and fast
- Excellent 2D engine
- GDScript is Python-like and easy to learn
- Active community development
- No royalties, no subscriptions, no strings attached

**Cons:**
- 3D capabilities lag behind Unity/Unreal
- Smaller asset ecosystem
- Fewer learning resources compared to Unity/Unreal
- Limited console support (though improving)

**My Take:** Godot is perfect for 2D games and indie developers who want complete control without licensing concerns. The 4.0 update has dramatically improved 3D capabilities. For 2D games, I'd choose Godot over Unity any day.

### Bevy
**Best for:** Indie 2D games, open-source projects, learning game development

**Pros:**

**Cons:**
- 3D capabilities lag behind Unity/Unreal
- Smaller asset ecosystem
- Fewer learning resources compared to Unity/Unreal
- Limited console support (though improving)

**My Take:** Bevy is perfect for indie 2D games and open-source projects. It's lightweight, fast, and has an excellent 2D engine. Rust-based, it's memory safe and fast. The active community development ensures regular updates and improvements. No royalties, no subscriptions, no strings attached.

### Phaser 2D
**Best for:** Indie 2D games, open-source projects, learning game development

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

**My Take:** Phaser is perfect for indie 2D games and open-source projects. It's easy to learn and use, with a large community and asset ecosystem. Cross-platform support and good performance make it a great choice for indie developers.

### Love2D
**Best for:** Indie 2D games, open-source projects, learning game development

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

**My Take:** Love2D is perfect for indie 2D games and open-source projects. It's lightweight, fast, and easy to learn and use. With a large community and asset ecosystem, it's a great choice for indie developers. Cross-platform support and good performance make it a great choice for indie developers.

### SpacetimeDB (for Multiplayer Games)
**Best for:** Real-time multiplayer games, persistent worlds, deterministic gameplay

**Pros:**
- Database as a game server - revolutionary approach
- Automatic state synchronization
- Built-in persistence
- Deterministic execution
- Written in Rust - memory safe and fast
- Perfect for strategy games, MMOs, persistent worlds

**Cons:**
- Newer technology with smaller community
- Requires rethinking traditional game architecture
- Limited to multiplayer/online games
- Steeper learning curve for traditional game developers

**My Take:** SpacetimeDB is a game-changer for multiplayer games. Instead of building traditional game servers with complex state management, SpacetimeDB treats your game logic as database queries. This is **incredibly powerful** for:
- Turn-based strategy games
- Persistent multiplayer worlds
- Games requiring complex state synchronization
- Projects where data consistency is critical

I've built several multiplayer prototypes with SpacetimeDB, and the development experience is unlike anything else. You write your game logic in Rust, and SpacetimeDB handles all the networking, state synchronization, and persistence automatically.

## Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Recommended Engine |
|----------|-------------------|
| Mobile puzzle game | Unity or Godot |
| AAA 3D shooter | Unreal Engine |
| 2D indie platformer | Godot |
| Cross-platform RPG | Unity |
| Photorealistic simulation | Unreal Engine |
| Real-time multiplayer strategy | SpacetimeDB + any renderer |
| MMO or persistent world | SpacetimeDB |
| Learning game dev | Godot |

## The Hybrid Approach

Here's something many developers don't consider: **you can mix engines**. For example:
- Use SpacetimeDB for server-side game logic and state management
- Use Unity or Godot for client-side rendering and input
- Get the best of both worlds

## My Personal Stack

For my multiplayer game projects, I typically use:
1. **SpacetimeDB** for backend game logic and state management
2. **Rust** for game logic (compiled to WebAssembly for clients)
3. **Unity or Godot** for client-side rendering (depending on 2D vs 3D needs)

This gives me:
- Deterministic, synchronized game state
- Fast, memory-safe backend code
- Flexible client rendering options
- Automatic persistence and state recovery

## Final Thoughts

The "best" game engine doesn't exist - it depends entirely on your project requirements:

- **Budget-conscious indie dev?** → Godot
- **Need AAA graphics?** → Unreal Engine
- **Building for mobile?** → Unity
- **Creating multiplayer/persistent world?** → SpacetimeDB
- **Just learning?** → Godot or Unity

The most important factor is **getting started**. Every engine can create amazing games in the right hands. Choose one, commit to learning it, and start building.
