*October 20, 2025*

When I started exploring game development, I quickly realized how overwhelming it can be to pick the right engine. There’s no shortage of options — each with its own philosophy, ecosystem, and quirks. As a developer, I’ve always been drawn to understanding tradeoffs, not just following trends. So instead of jumping straight into the most popular engine, I spent time testing and comparing several of them.

Of course, the most productive approach is often to stick with what you already know. I could have just built my first game in **Java**, a language I know deeply and one that can run anywhere. My former colleague Andreas, for example, built great indie titles like *Astroloot* and *Mazebert* entirely in Java.

But I wanted to explore the broader world of game engines — to learn *why* people choose what they do, and how different technologies shape the development experience. Here’s what I found.

## Phaser 2D

**Best for:** Browser-based 2D games, web-first prototypes, quick iterations

**Pros:**

* Really easy to learn — it’s basically just JavaScript with extra tools for canvas, sprites, and input control.
* Excellent performance for web games.
* Integrates nicely with React or other JS frameworks.
* Easy to deploy and host anywhere.

**Cons:**

* React hooks and state management can make it tricky to fully understand game states at first.
* The official editor is a paid product.

**My Take:**
Phaser feels natural if you’re coming from a web background. It’s perfect for lightweight projects or learning game loops without worrying about installations or exports. If you love JavaScript and want instant results, Phaser is incredibly satisfying.

## Unity

**Best for:** Cross-platform 2D/3D games, mobile titles, and polished indie projects

**Pros:**

* Great editor and visual workflow.
* Outstanding performance and mature tooling.
* C# scripting feels powerful and familiar for .NET developers.
* Massive ecosystem, tutorials, and assets.

**Cons:**

* Built heavily on inheritance, which can lead to complex hierarchies.
* Licensing and versioning have become a bit messy lately.

**My Take:**
Unity still offers a balance between accessibility and power. It’s fast to iterate, versatile, and battle-tested. But as the ecosystem grows, managing dependencies and versions can be frustrating. Still, for polished indie or mobile projects, Unity is hard to beat.

## Godot

**Best for:** 2D pixel art games, open-source lovers, and rapid prototyping

**Pros:**

* Super simple interface and fully open source.
* Fantastic documentation and community.
* Great for pixel art or small 2D projects.
* Supports GDScript (similar to Python) and C#.
* Perfect for quick prototypes.

**Cons:**

* Also built around inheritance, which can become messy if not planned well.
* Systems need to be carefully connected to avoid strong coupling between classes.

**My Take:**
Godot feels cozy. It’s like a friendly workshop where you can tinker freely. It’s lightweight, transparent, and ideal for experimenting. For small to mid-sized projects, it’s a joy — especially if you value openness over polish.

## Bevy

**Best for:** Rust developers, ECS enthusiasts, scalable 2D/3D games

**Pros:**

* Excellent performance and scalability.
* Built on the ECS (Entity Component System) paradigm.
* Easy integration of modular systems.
* Fully code-based and expressive in Rust.

**Cons:**

* No visual editor.
* Rust’s borrow checker and compile times can slow iteration.
* Still in alpha — documentation and ecosystem are young.

**My Take:**
Bevy is exciting. It’s what happens when modern software architecture meets game dev. I love how clean and modular it feels, but it’s definitely early-stage. If you enjoy Rust and don’t mind a bit of friction, Bevy rewards you with clarity and performance.

## Unreal Engine

**Best for:** AAA-quality 3D games, stunning visuals, and cinematic experiences

**Pros:**

* Industry-leading graphics with Lumen and Nanite.
* Blueprint visual scripting.
* Great level design tools.
* Free until your game earns serious revenue.

**Cons:**

* Blueprint graphs can become messy quickly.
* High complexity and steep learning curve.
* Heavy system requirements.

**My Take:**
Unreal is jaw-dropping. Every time I open it, I’m amazed at what’s possible — but also reminded that it’s a professional tool. If you’re after realistic lighting, massive worlds, or cinematic storytelling, Unreal is unmatched. For small 2D experiments though, it’s like bringing a rocket launcher to a water balloon fight.

## Love2D

**Best for:** Simple 2D games, fast prototyping, and learning Lua

**Pros:**

* Really simple and lightweight.
* Super fast development cycle.
* Encourages clean, structured code.

**Cons:**

* No editor — you’ll be writing everything manually.

**My Take:**
Love2D feels like old-school coding joy. You open your editor, write Lua, and see results instantly. It’s minimal but empowering. If you love control and simplicity, it’s a wonderful way to understand the fundamentals of game loops and rendering.

## The Hybrid Approach

Here’s something many developers overlook: **you can mix engines**.

For example, you can:

* Use **SpacetimeDB** for your backend logic and persistence.
* Connect it to a **Unity** or **Godot** client for rendering and input.
* Combine the strengths of both worlds: stable multiplayer and flexible visuals.

---

## My Personal Stack

For most of my multiplayer experiments, I currently use:

1. **SpacetimeDB** for backend logic and state management
2. **Rust** for deterministic, memory-safe game logic
3. **Godot or Bevy** for client-side rendering

This combination gives me deterministic state handling, fast code, and flexible front-end visuals — all without reinventing the wheel.

## Final Thoughts

It was a pleasure to explore these engines and learn about their unique strengths. Each one has its place in the game development landscape, and I’m excited to see how they evolve in the future.
Always keep in mind to target the platforms where your users are most likely to play your game. This could be mobile devices, desktop computers, consoles, or even web browsers. Understanding your target audience and their preferences will help you make informed decisions.
